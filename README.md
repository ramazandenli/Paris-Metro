# Paris Metro
A Java project utilizing graph structures focuses on the Paris Metro System. The project is implemented in Java and requires the development of an algorithm to determine the optimal route between a specified starting station and a destination. The optimization criteria include minimizing the number of stops and reducing travel time. For the first criterion, the graph assigns equal weights to all edges, while for the second, it incorporates the given time intervals between consecutive stations. Each metro station is represented as a node, and each connection between two successive stations in a specific direction is modeled as a directed edge, forming a transportation graph. To enable point-to-point queries within the transit network, transfer edges are necessary, allowing passengers to either travel by train or walk between stations when switching lines. Additionally, walk-distance edges help integrate different transportation networks such as buses, trains, metro, and ferries. Two stations, u and v, are considered neighboring stops when a walkable road segment exists between them and the distance dist(u, v) does not exceed the maximum permitted walking distance.
